# MQTT plugin for Ark Ecosystem

MQTT plugin that broadcasts events to an MQTT broker. At the moment this plugin only broadcasts but
might be extended with additional features as well as including an MQTT server so users won't have
to run a separate MQTT broker.

If you have any feature requests don't forget to open an Issue.
